$ swiftc signal_04.swift -o signal_04
$ ./signal_04

swift code created the argv array:
["less", "/etc/passwd", nil]
Then execvp("less", argv) was called â€” which replaced your Swift process with the less command.
The less pager opened /etc/passwd, 
Each line represents a system user and their login shell/home directory.

ðŸ”š Once you quit less (pressing q), the process ends.
strdup() duplicates Swift strings into C memory.

args becomes a C-style argv array ending with nil.

execvp() replaces the running process with /usr/bin/less /etc/passwd.

If it fails, control returns and perror prints the reason.
